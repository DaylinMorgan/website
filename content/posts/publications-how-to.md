My inspiration for this process draws heavily from this [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/03/automatically-importing-publications-from-bibtex-to-a-hugo-academic-blog-2/). Since my preferred scripting language is python I chose that to make a simple script to build out the necessary directory and files. 

My script which can be found [here](https://github.com/DaylinMorgan/website/blob/main/publications/bibtextomd.py) for this site relies primarily on the [bibtexparser] project.
