  abstract = {A significant challenge in the field of biomedicine is the development of methods to integrate the multitude of dispersed data sets into comprehensive frameworks to be used to generate optimal clinical decisions. Recent technological advances in single cell analysis allow for high-dimensional molecular characterization of cells and populations, but to date, few mathematical models have attempted to integrate measurements from the single cell scale with other types of longitudinal data. Here, we present a framework that actionizes static outputs from a machine learning model and leverages these as measurements of state variables in a dynamic model of treatment response. We apply this framework to breast cancer cells to integrate single cell transcriptomic data with longitudinal bulk cell population (bulk time course) data. We demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of the phenotypic composition estimate, derived from single cell RNA-sequencing data (scRNA-seq), improves accuracy in the prediction of new treatments with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.92 compared to a prediction accuracy of CCC = 0.64 when fitting on longitudinal bulk cell population data alone. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly integrates single cell clonally-resolved transcriptome datasets with bulk time-course data to jointly calibrate a mathematical model of drug resistance dynamics. We anticipate this approach to be a first step that demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating multiple data types into mathematical models to develop optimized treatment regimens from data.},

  abstract = {Astrocytes comprise the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) and play critical roles in maintaining neural tissue homeostasis. In addition, astrocyte dysfunction and death has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). As such, there is much interest in using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived astrocytes for drug screening, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine applications. However, current protocols for generation of astrocytes from hPSCs are limited by the use of undefined xenogeneic components and two-dimensional (2D) culture surfaces, which limits their downstream applications where large-quantities of cells generated under defined conditions are required. Here, we report the use of a completely synthetic, peptide-based substrate that allows for the differentiation of highly pure populations of astrocytes from several independent hPSC lines, including those derived from patients with neurodegenerative disease. This substrate, which we demonstrate is compatible with both conventional 2D culture formats and scalable microcarrier (MC)-based technologies, leads to the generation of cells that express high levels of canonical astrocytic markers as well as display properties characteristic of functionally mature cells including production of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli, ability to take up amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}), and appearance of robust calcium transients. Finally, we show that these astrocytes can be cryopreserved without any loss of functionality. In the future, we anticipate that these methods will enable the development of bioprocesses for the production of hPSC-derived astrocytes needed for biomedical research and clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Human pluripotent stem cell derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) have the unique properties of long-term in vitro expansion as well as differentiation into the various neurons and supporting cell types of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of these characteristics, hNPCs have tremendous potential in the modeling and treatment of various CNS diseases and disorders. However, expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs in quantities necessary for these applications is not possible with current two dimensional (2-D) approaches. Here, we used a fully defined peptide substrate as the basis for a microcarrier (MC)-based suspension culture system. Several independently derived hNPC lines were cultured on MCs for multiple passages as well as efficiently differentiated to neurons. Finally, this MC-based system was used in conjunction with a low shear rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the integrated, large-scale expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs. Overall, this fully defined and scalable biomanufacturing system will facilitate the generation of hNPCs and their neuronal derivatives in quantities necessary for basic and translational applications. Statement of Significance In this work, we developed a microcarrier (MC)-based culture system that allows for the expansion and neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) under defined conditions. In turn, this MC approach was implemented in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the large-scale expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs. This work is of significance as it overcomes current limitations of conventional two dimensional (2-D) culture systems to enable the generation of hNPCs and their neuronal derivatives in quantities required for downstream applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine.},
